How to run SBT hit rate analysis on lxplus:

1. Install FairShip software following instructions in
	https://github.com/ShipSoft/FairShip/blob/master/README.md

	# Important: for the muonbackground analysis you need to change a few lines in FairShip/macro/runSimScript.py
	Add to run_SimScript.py after import ROOT:

		ROOT.gROOT.ProcessLine('#include "FairEventHeader.h"')
		ROOT.gROOT.ProcessLine('#include "FairMCPoint.h"')


2. cd FairShip/runSBT

3. ./compile.sh  #it will compile getEntries.C script for getting number of events from root files

4. ./getEntriesForAllFiles.sh #this script provide getEntriesForAllFiles.out with the list of all root files
                              #in your dataset with their number of events
    #To define data set check line 4, and define your files in for loop
	/eos/experiment/ship/data/Mbias/background-prod-2018/pythia8_Geant4_10.0_withCharmandBeauty{0..66000..1000}_mu.root

5. ./createRunSimList.sh > queue_list.txt #create queue list for simulation step,
                                          #which will be used by condor submit script
    #To define number of events per run change 'eventsPerRunMax' variable

6.a #create config file:
	 source /cvmfs/ship.cern.ch/SHiP-2021/latest/setUp.sh
	 alienv load FairShip/latest > config.sh # (make sure you have NOT loaded the Fairship environment)

6. condor_submit sim.sub # Start simulation

   # Important.
     1.Check that all directories which assigned to 'output', 'error' and 'log' in sim.sub are existing.
     2.Check that OUTPUTDIR path in sim.sh is correct
		 3.Check path for config.sh file is correct

7. ./createRunRecoList.sh > queue_list_reco.txt #create queue	list for simulation step,
                                                #which will be used by condor submit script

    # Impotrant.
     1.Check 'inPath', it should point to directory with files created at simulations step

8. condor_submit reco.sub # Start reconstruction step

   # Impotrant.
     1.Check that all directories which assigned to 'output', 'error' and 'log' in reco.sub are existing.
     2.Check that 'OUTPUTDIR' and 'INPUTDIR' pathes in reco.sh are correct

9. ./createRunAnaList.sh > queue_list_ana.txt #create queue   list for analysis step,
                                                #which will be used by condor submit script

    # Impotrant.
     1.Check 'inPath', it should point to directory with files created at reconstruction step

10. condor_submit vetoana.sub # Start analysis step
	 # This saves relevant info into csv files and stores them at given location.
   # Impotrant.
     1.Check that all directories which assigned to 'output', 'error' and 'log' in vetoana.sub are existing.
     2.Check that 'OUTPUTDIR' and 'INPUTDIR' pathes in ana.sh are correct
     3.Be sure you call correct vetoana.py script in vetoana.sh
